<!-- What this item changes about `editor`. Folded into
     .abydos/backlog/spec/editor.md by `abydos-backlog done`.

     ADDED, MODIFIED and REMOVED. A rename is a REMOVED and an ADDED.
     Write each requirement as it will read in the spec, in the present
     tense — not as a description of the edit.
     The requirements already there, to name exactly:
       ⌘/ comments out the lines a selection touches
       the comment goes at the indent the lines share
       blank lines are neither commented nor counted
       the selection still covers the same text afterwards
       a language with no line comment says so rather than nothing
       an embedded language gets its host's comment, not its own
       ⌘/ is ⌘/ on every keyboard
       ↑ on the first line and ↓ on the last go to the edge of the file
       Shift takes the selection to the edge with it

     One MODIFIED and no ADDED, on purpose. 0494 wrote two requirements:
     the first is about a vertical key *running out of rows*, which is not
     what ⌘↑ does — it jumps to the end of the document from wherever the
     caret is, and never asks about a row — so ⌘⇧↑ does not belong under
     it. The second is the rule this item implements, word for word:
     Shift decides only whether the selection comes along. A third ADDED
     would be that same sentence with two more keys in it, and a spec that
     says one rule twice is a spec where the two copies eventually
     disagree. So the ⌘ pair joins the requirement whose rule it is.

## MODIFIED Requirement: Shift takes the selection to the edge with it

Shift decides only whether the selection comes along, and nothing else about
where the caret lands. ⇧↑ on the first line selects from the caret back to the
start of the file, and ⇧↓ on the last selects from the caret to the end of it —
which on those two lines is the same thing as selecting to the start or the end
of the line, since the two offsets coincide. ⇧⇞ and ⇧⇟ do the same with a
screenful as the step.

⌘⇧↑ and ⌘⇧↓ do it from anywhere. ⌘↑ and ⌘↓ are the jump to the start and the
end of the document — not a key that ran out of rows, but the motion whose
whole purpose is the edge — and they are the same motion from the middle of a
file as from either end of it. Holding Shift changes only that the text between
where the caret was and where it lands is selected, so from halfway down a file
⌘⇧↑ selects everything above the caret and ⌘⇧↓ everything below it.

Soft wrap makes no difference to those two. Every other key in this
requirement moves by rows, and a row is a wrapped segment rather than a line;
the jump to the ends of the document is offsets and never asks about a row.

### Scenario: ⇧↑ on the first line

- **Given** a file whose first line begins `one word001`, the caret at column 8
- **When** ⇧↑ is pressed
- **Then** the caret is at offset 0 and `one word` is selected

### Scenario: ⇧↓ on the last line

- **Given** the caret at column 4 of the last line, `seventh and last line of the file`
- **When** ⇧↓ is pressed
- **Then** the caret is at the end of the file and `nth and last line of the file` is selected

### Scenario: ⇧⇟ on the last line

- **Given** the caret at column 4 of the last line of a file shorter than the window
- **When** ⇧⇟ is pressed
- **Then** the selection reaches the end of the file, as ⇧↓ does

### Scenario: ⌘⇧↑ from the middle of a file

- **Given** a file of seven lines ending at offset 863, the caret at column 4 of line 3, which is offset 775
- **When** ⌘⇧↑ is pressed
- **Then** the caret is at offset 0 and everything from 0 to 775 is selected

### Scenario: ⌘⇧↓ from the middle of a file

- **Given** the same file and the same caret at offset 775
- **When** ⌘⇧↓ is pressed
- **Then** the caret is at offset 863 and everything from 775 to 863 is selected

### Scenario: ⌘↑ and ⌘↓ without Shift, from the same place

- **Given** the same file and the same caret at offset 775
- **When** ⌘↑ is pressed, and then, from offset 775 again, ⌘↓
- **Then** the caret lands on offset 0 and then on offset 863, the same two
  places the shifted pair land on, and nothing is selected either time
