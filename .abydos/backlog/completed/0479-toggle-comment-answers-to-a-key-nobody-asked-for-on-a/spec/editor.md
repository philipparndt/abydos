<!-- What this item changes about `editor`. Folded into
     .abydos/backlog/spec/editor.md by `abydos-backlog done`.

     ADDED, MODIFIED and REMOVED. A rename is a REMOVED and an ADDED.
     Write each requirement as it will read in the spec, in the present
     tense — not as a description of the edit.
     The requirements already there, to name exactly:
       ⌘/ comments out the lines a selection touches
       the comment goes at the indent the lines share
       blank lines are neither commented nor counted
       the selection still covers the same text afterwards
       a language with no line comment says so rather than nothing
       an embedded language gets its host's comment, not its own
-->

## ADDED Requirement: ⌘/ is ⌘/ on every keyboard

Edit ▸ Toggle Comment reads **⌘/** whatever the keyboard is set to, and the press
is whatever makes a `/` on that keyboard — ⌘/ where the slash is unshifted, ⌘⇧7
on a German layout, and so on. It is the shortcut every editor documents, and a
person told "⌘/" finds it in the menu spelled that way.

macOS would otherwise move it. The system relocates a key equivalent it judges
awkward on the current layout to one needing no shift, and on a German keyboard
that put Toggle Comment on **⌘ß** — a key nobody would try for commenting, while
⌘⇧7 reached nothing at all. So this one item keeps its literal key.

**Only this one.** Every other shortcut in the app is still the system's to move,
and is better for it: `[`, `]`, `\` and `=` all need ⌥ on a German keyboard, and the
system puts them on the key in the same place a US keyboard has them — Back and
Forward read ⌘Ö and ⌘Ä there, and answer to them, rather than needing ⌥⌘5 and ⌥⌘6.
Every shortcut in the menu bar is reachable by the press the menu shows.

### Scenario: a German keyboard, where a slash is a shifted 7

- **Given** the keyboard layout is German
- **When** the Edit menu is opened
- **Then** Toggle Comment reads ⌘/

### Scenario: pressing it on that keyboard

- **Given** a Swift file open on a machine with a German layout
- **When** ⌘⇧7 is pressed, which is how a `/` is typed there
- **Then** the caret's line is commented out

### Scenario: the slash on a numeric keypad

- **Given** the same file, and a keyboard with a numeric keypad
- **When** ⌘ and the keypad's `/` are pressed
- **Then** the caret's line is commented out, the same as ⌘⇧7 does

### Scenario: a shortcut whose key needs option on that keyboard

- **Given** the same keyboard, on which `[` is typed with ⌥5
- **When** the Edit menu is opened
- **Then** Back reads ⌘Ö, the key where `[` is on a US keyboard, and answers to it
